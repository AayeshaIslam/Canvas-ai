## üìå Project Overview

This project delivers a completed AI-powered tool that allows faculty to easily convert PDF course materials into fully formatted quizzes for their Canvas courses.

By simply uploading a PDF, instructors can receive a bank of well-structured, relevant quiz questions generated through AI, which are then automatically uploaded to their Canvas course, eliminating the need for manual formatting or question entry.

The tool is designed to streamline the quiz creation process and make it more accessible, especially for instructors managing multiple courses or large classes.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic content extraction
- AI-generated questions tailored to material
- Seamless Canvas integration
- Time-saving for large or multiple courses
